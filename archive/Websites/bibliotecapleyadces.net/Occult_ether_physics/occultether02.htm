			<font face="Arial" size="2">The 1910 first edition of this book was probably the most 
			comprehensive book ever published on ether theory as it existed in 
			1910, but the 1951 revision merely clarified �acceptable� ether

			In his preface, <b>Whittaker</b> stated that where space is now considered

			vacuum with a new status as the location of �zero point� 
			oscillations of the electromagnetic fields and zero point

			threw the dirt over the 29 corpse of ether theory while it was still

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Much of the error was due to focusing 
			on the weakest proponents who believed that a portion of the ether 
			is �carried along� by the earth, and that an optical aberration

			order for an ether to exist. It was asserted that the failure of

			since, are man-made electro-propulsive flying machines which can

			accelerate almost instantaneously to at least 9,000 mph, without

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The ship I observed in 1953, in 
			broad daylight, hovering at about 300 feet distance, about 250 feet 
			above ground level, precessed at a high angle�about 45 degrees�and a 
			low rate of about two precessions per second. Soon after I spotted 
			it, it began to move away directly due west, quickly accelerating to 
			about 800 mph, at which time it did two absolutely square turns�a 
			right angle turn straight down and another right angle turn back to 
			level flight�then accelerated to a point of infinity above the

			50-foot diameter stainless steel woks joined together clamshell 
			fashion. It had concentric �striations��grooves in its surface which 
			appeared to be about one inch wide all over its surface�which gave 
			its bottom half the appearance of a giant �spun-metal� wok, as it precessed with the sun�s rays playing on its bright metallic

			<font face="Arial" size="2">As it precessed, it gave off a sparkling, �rainbow-colored� 
			electrical corona, like a metallic surface which was being 
			electrified with high voltage Tesla currents. On the shadow side of

			a soft, �cloudy�, infra-red glow, which indicated the possible

			trail which appeared to indicate the frequency of the pulses. Since 
			the lines appeared to be �about� five feet apart at �about� 200 mph, 
			the frequency could have been 60 cycles per second�a frequency which 
			is very low, with the approx. 5-foot-spaced pulses coming at the 
			quarter wavelength. This rough guess is based on what �200 m.p.h.�

			On a Wednesday evening, January 24, 1996, at approximately 7:00 PM,

			<font face="Arial" size="2">It returned to its starting point, skidded to a halt, and began

			The ether is transparent, because of its ultra fine, high frequency

			The stationary ether, appearing to move through an earth-bound body,

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The electrical displacement in the ether outside the body

			These changes in turn cause the changes in electric displacement of

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The �equilibrium

			In summary, inside an earth-bound body at rest relative to the 
			earth, there is a difference in polarization and displacement 
			effects, from those which exist outside the body in free space. 
			Since earth�s electric field is graduated through the intermediate 
			space, between the negative at earth�s surface, and the positive at 
			the ionosphere, the dielectric properties are subjected to graduated

			always been considered (according to <i>Newton�s First Law of Motion</i>) 
			the tendency of a body �at rest� or in �constant velocity� 
			relative to the earth, to continue its state of rest or constant 
			velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Since all bodies

			�constant velocity� of the earth however, only changes in movement 
			relative to the earth are at issue, and any such changes affect the 
			patterns of flow within mass of the tubes of force, as it moves 
			through the ether, at any given time. Since only a body which moves 
			in respect to the earth has been traditionally said to have 
			�momentum� (�the product of a body�s mass and velocity�), this rule 
			is wrong, since all bodies �at rest� relative to earth already have

			<u>Momentum and inertia</u> are due to the exact same �tendency�, which

			Tesla�s statements concerning the effects of �rapidly varying

			The micro helical rotation of these tubules are the product of the

			resistance to change in micro helical pitch, since the rotating 
			tubes of force spin around so much of the irrotational ether cores 
			(�Onmi�) over a given period of time, and a change in motion 
			requires them to rotate around a commensurately greater or lesser
