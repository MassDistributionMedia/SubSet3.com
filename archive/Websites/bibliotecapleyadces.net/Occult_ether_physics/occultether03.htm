			<b>Wm. Thomson</b> (<u>Lord Kelvin</u>) first asserted that magnetism possesses a 
			�rotatory� character related to heat or the thermal motions of a 
			body (Proc. R.S. viii [1856], p. 150). <b>Nikola Tesla</b> made many 
			references to Wm. Thomson, pointing to his work as a prelude to his 
			own discoveries and applications which especially intensified in 
			1892. A review of the work of the world�s major minds leading up to 
			Tesla�s breakthrough is necessary to show just what Tesla discovered 
			and what it meant in respect to ether physics and physics in

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Around 1870, <u>Thomson</u> had conducted experiments which seemed 
			to indicate that �gravitational action� could be induced by spheroidal bodies oscillated by electrical currents or mechanical 
			pulses (F. Guthrie Phil. Mag. xli [1871], p. 405). The surface 
			pulsations could cause attractions or repulsions in respect to other 
			bodies, as verified by Thomson. Tesla was aware of Thomson�s work 
			during his student days in Graz, Austria, beginning 1875, when he 
			was 19. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Thomson�s work undoubtedly served as the spark of 
			inspiration for Tesla in his early conception of an �ideal flying 
			machine� which would be propelled by electricity acting upon the 
			ether. This explains Tesla�s continual references to Thomson, such

			At first, <u>Thomson</u> found that <i>ponderomotive forces</i> act between two 
			solid bodies immersed in an incompressible fluid, when one of the 
			bodies is immobilized and made to oscillate with a force which acts 
			along a line between its center and that of a much larger sphere 
			which is free. The free sphere was attracted to the smaller 
			(immobilized) sphere, if its density was greater than the fluid, 
			while a sphere of less density than the fluid was repelled or 
			attracted, according to the ratio of its distance to the vibrator in 
			relation to a certain quantity (Phil. Mag, xli [1871], p. 405; 
			Letter, Thomson to F. Guthrie, p. 427.)<br>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Thomson�s experiments were analogical ones, for which he had evoked 
			praise from his contemporaries even when he was still a teenager, 
			although his refusal to believe anyone�s assertions unless he could 
			build an analogical model to prove them often led to the 
			consternation of those of his contemporaries, such as <u>Maxwell</u>, who 
			relied often on mathematical equations. The sphere experiments 
			were designed to use mechanical and electrical wave methods to 
			construct a model to probe the gravitational, inertial and momentive 
			reactions of solid bodies in the ether.</font></p>

			The Faraday effect�the rotation of the plane of polarization of 
			radiation in a dielectric medium (such as the atmosphere, space, and 
			certain solid materials) in a magnetic field�stated that the angle 
			of rotation of radiation is proportional to the magnetic field 
			strength and the length of the path in the medium in the field. 
			These early experimenters knew there was a connection between the 
			rotatory motion and momentum, and sought to find it.</font></p>

			The rotatory (versus the linear) character of magnetic phenomena was 
			strengthened by Thomson�s experimentally verified conclusions on the 
			magnetic rotation of light. This rotatory character not only 
			influenced Tesla�s discovery of the rotating magnetic field, but is 
			also fundamental to inertia and momentum, as I will later explain, 
			since movement of a charged body constitutes a current which creates 
			a magnetic field which creates the rotatory motion which �bores� 
			through the ether like a drill to create momentum.</font></p>

			Thomson�s system was later investigated by <b>C.A. Bjerknes</b> between 
			1877 and 1910. Bjerknes showed that when two spheres immersed in an 
			incompressible fluid were pulsated, they exerted a mutual attraction 
			which obeyed Newton�s inverse square law if the pulsations were in 
			phase, while if the phases differed by a half wave, the spheres 
			repelled. At one quarter wave difference, there was no action. Where 
			pulses were non-instantaneous at distances greater than a quarter 
			wavelength, attractions and repulsions were reversed (Repertorium d. 
			Mathematik I [Leipzig, 1877], p. 268; Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. iii

			In 1879, <b>Edwin H. Hall</b> (Amer. Jour. Math, ii [1879], p. 287) a 
			student in Baltimore, repeated an experiment suggested by H. A. 
			Rowland, his professor, whose original experiment with a gold-foilcovered 
			ebonite disk in a magnetic field showed that electric charges on a 
			disk were carried around with it as it was rotated (Ann, d. Phys, 
			clviii [1876], p. 487). In Hall�s experiment, a gold leaf strip in 
			which a current was flowing, was placed into a magnetic gap. This 
			produced an electromotive force at right angles to the magnetic 
			field and the current, which was proportional to the product of the 
			two. Called the �Hall Effect�, it was already inherent in the three 
			previous effects discovered much earlier by Faraday.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Faraday had discovered induction, by forcing a conductor through a 
			magnetic field, cutting the lines of magnetic force and producing a 
			current in the conductor. The second of Faraday�s triad was 
			production of a magnetic field in an unmagnetized iron core, by 
			forcing a current-carrying conductor through a gap between the poles 
			of a core. Faraday�s third effect was the generation of a current. 
			Though Hall�s effect was inherent in the fact that it was the 
			reverse of the force required by Faraday to push the conductor 
			through a magnetic field. Hall�s work completed the triad of 
			effects, by bringing it into consciousness. This effect is the basis 
			for <b>MHD</b> (Magneto-Hydrodynamic) generators, and <u>electropropulsion</u>, 
			through the special means which would finally be brought into 
			fruition by the work of <u>Tesla</u>.</font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Since the galvanometer needle in Hall�s experiment was deflected 
			only when the magnetic field arose or collapsed, the physical thrust 
			created was a vector product which had already been expressly 
			suggested in Maxwell�s Treatise (1862), almost 15 years earlier 
			(derived from Maxwell�s analysis relative to Faraday�s work of c. 
			1845), though Maxwell failed to follow up with experiment (because

			Though it was said by <b>Whittaker</b> that the <b>Hall</b> effect, like the 
			magnetic rotation of light, occurs only in ponderable bodies and not 
			in the �free ether�, this statement was patently false, since the 
			effect actually depends on the conductivity of a medium. This was a 
			definite lie on Whittaker�s part, probably �required� under the 1951 
			revision. The fact that the effect occurs in �ponderable bodies� and 
			�conductive media� however, is all-important for electropropulsion, 
			since it shows the reaction between such bodies and media and the 
			underlying �etheric framework� which is accessed in the process.</font></p>

			Since the �natural media� (the ether and the atmosphere) so often 
			referred to by Tesla in his patents become conductive under the 
			influence of electromagnetic radiation of sufficiently high voltage 
			and frequency, the effects in the free ether, dependent upon proper 
			conditions, can affect the ether within a ponderable body, so as to 
			move the body through the free ether. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The most startling proof that 
			the Hall effect works in the free ether, was Tesla�s �transmission� 
			of electrical energy through space by high frequency oscillations, 
			as detailed in his 1892 Lecture before the Institute of Electrical 
			Engineers, London. Since an electric field �displaces� the 
			ether�which is the basis for <u>MHD</u> pumping (especially when 
			pulsed)�the effect actually showed an operable �electromotive force� 
			(�emf�), or �electro-propulsive force�, between ponderable bodies

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The high voltage 
			and high frequency are required by the ether�s great density and 
			ultra-fineness. The moment Tesla had succeeded in transmitting 
			electrical energy by means of high voltage, high frequency 
			currents��radio waves��the ether was �accessed�. Tesla�s work at 
			that point had already verified experimentally everything that 
			Maxwell had mathematically analyzed as being the electromagnetic

			Though it was strongly implied, the literature available to me 
			failed to explicitly state the idea that inertia and momentum are 
			the products of an electromagnetic rotatory force which acts within 
			bodies, upon a dense, incompressible ether which permeates all 
			bodies and all space. Neither was it specified that a pulsating 
			sphere or other ponderable body can be electrically propelled 
			through the ether, without the presence of another sphere or other 
			ponderable body to pull against�except in the statements of <b>Nikola 
			Tesla</b> and his �flivver�/�model T� <i>electropulsive</i> �ideal electric 
			flying machine�.</font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			In 1884, the year Tesla discovered the rotating magnetic field, <u>J.J. 
			Thomson</u> attempted to determine the field produced by a moving 
			electrified sphere, and the mathematical development of Maxwell�s 
			theory accelerated. It was naturally easier to solve such problems 
			from the known behaviors of simple geometric forms�planes, spheres, 
			and cylinders (J.J. Thomson, Proc. Lond. Math. Soc. xv [1884], p. 
			197). </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The possibility that the ether was composed of stationary 
			positive charges carrying their own �sub-electronic� negative 
			charges which were elastic, and could be displaced, had apparently 
			evaded the thinking of Thomson. Although he had assumed that 
			displacement currents must occur in the ether, he had earlier 
			thought this was due to the magnetic effects of moving charges, 
			though he failed to show how the displacement currents occurred, or 
			what their effects were in terms of inertia and momentum.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			There was already a sort of battle brewing between the proponents of 
			classical electrodynamics, and the proponents led by <u>Maxwell</u> of an 
			electromagnetic theory of light. To the former, conductivity 
			occurred in metal wires, etc., while with Maxwell, it occurred in 
			the surrounding dielectrics and ether-filled space, with the 
			conductors serving only to �guide� the action. Tesla appeared to fit 
			more into the Faraday/Maxwell camp. <u>FitzGerald</u> had unified the two 
			views by arguing validly that Maxwell�s unification was valid 
			because radiation could be generated by purely electrical means.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Along this line, Thomson (1884) first considered a charged sphere 
			moving uniformly in a straight line. He assumed that the electric 
			charges were uniformly distributed, with an electric field the same 
			in all directions, no matter what position the sphere was in, the 
			same as if it were at rest. This assumption proved true so long as 
			the velocity of the sphere and the velocity of light were neglected.</font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			In 1889, <b>Wm. Thomson</b> (Proc. Roy. Irish Acad. i [30 Nov. 1889], p. 
			340), stated, �Rotational vortex-cores must be discarded; and we 
			must have nothing but irrotational revolution and vacuous cores.� By 
			this, Thomson meant that the vacuous �ether�, inside rotating tubes 
			of electromagnetism, did not rotate, presumably because of its 
			density, but also because, if the cores rotated along with the 
			rotating tubes of electromagnetic force, it would neutralize the 
			electro-mechanical action by which momentum is created.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			<u>FitzGerald</u> found a purported error in Thomson�s work, saying that 
			the required �circuital condition� was not satisfied unless the 
			moving charges on the sphere were considered as current, combined 
			with the displacement and convection currents due to the motion. In 
			correcting Thomson�s error, FitzGerald went overboard in concluding 
			that the magnetic force due to the displacement currents of the 
			moving sphere, had no resultant effect. In this conclusion, FitzGerald seemed to have forgotten the �Faraday cage� and 
			�magneto-optical� effects, since a moving charged sphere would 
			constitute a current by his own admission, and all currents create 
			magnetic fields, which cause the rotation of electromagnetic 
			radiation and light in the surrounding ether as a resultant effect.</font></p>

			In 1888, <b>Oliver Heaviside</b> showed that the electrostatic and 
			electromagnetic units �vanished� inside the sphere. This was the 
			opposite to Faraday�s experiment in which electrostatic charges 
			placed inside a stationary, closed vessel, �appeared� on the 
			outside. Apparently, movement of the sphere�which increases its 
			momentum�appeared to Heaviside to force the charges back inside. 
			Heaviside�s conception of the �spherical� symmetry of charges during 
			movement was disproved by <u>G.C.F. Searle</u> in 1896 (Phil. Trans, clxxxvii [1896], p. 675). </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Searle</b> found that a moving �point charge� 
			system is not a sphere, but an oblate spheroid, with a polar axis

			was the importance of this finding, a connection between inertia, 
			momentum, current, surface charges �vanishing� and �reappearing�, 
			and an electromagnetic polarity along the direction of momentum, as 
			well as an electro-mechanical link to the ether, since the 
			displacement of the electric lines and polarity correspond to the 
			movement, consistent to my thinking that the tubules create momentum 
			inside a moving body. The �vanishing� electrostatic/electromagnetic 
			units are �occupied� internally by the microhelices, in perpetuating

			During this time, <b>Nikola Tesla</b> had not tarried. He had already shown

			In his lecture before the A.I.E.E. at Columbia College, N.Y., May 
			20, 1891, he demonstrated his years-old technology, and stated that

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">This statement reflects Tesla�s prior tests, since, prior to his

			The �specially constructed alternator� of which <b>Tesla</b> spoke was a 
			32-inch diameter one, which if similar to the type used on the

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The saucer I saw in 1953 exhibited precessional characteristics 
			which could have been caused by the use of such an alternator, the 
			output and rpms of which under the circumstances could have been 
			varied with the power level of the saucer, as if it were being 
			turned progressively faster by a turbine as the ship used more power 
			to accelerate. The high angle and low frequency of the precessions 
			would be consistent with the use of a high frequency, large diameter 
			alternator, which was turned more slowly at hovering power, and 
			increased in rpm for more power as the ship accelerated.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Since the alternator would likely have been attached rigidly to the 
			airframe of the saucer, it could have caused the entire saucer to 
			precess at hovering power, while the downward acceleration due to 
			gravity was being balanced by the upward <i>electropulsive 
			acceleration</i>, as the ship hovered in place above the earth. This 
			phenomenon showed that the precession I observed in 1953 was either 
			due to rotating internal machinery, or to the �virtual� angular 
			momentum created by the <i>electropulsive effects</i>.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			The balanced forces holding the ship in mid-air would have been 
			equivalent to holding it on �gimbals of air�, so that it precessed

			Tesla commenced to complete his <u>Dynamic Theory of Gravity</u> at the

			theories had been revealed in the three lectures, often illustrated 
			with demonstrations using Tesla-invented equipment, as revealed in 
			the following eight excerpts, in pertinent part (emphasis mine):</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
				<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1.</b> �The most probable medium filling the space is one consisting of 
			independent carriers immersed in an insulating fluid�.<br><b>2.</b> �In his experiments he dwells first on some phenomena produced by 
			electrostatic force, which he considers in the light of modern 
			theories to be the most important force in nature for us to 
			investigate.�<br><b>3.</b> �He illustrates how mechanical motions are produced by a varying 
			electrostatic force acting through a gaseous medium.�<br><b>4.</b> �One of the most interesting results arrived at in pursuing these 
			experiments, is the demonstration of the fact that a gaseous medium 
			upon which vibration is impressed by rapid changes of electrostatic 
			potential, is rigid �<br><b>5.</b> �If through this medium enormous electrostatic stresses are 
			assumed to act, which vary rapidly in intensity, it would allow the 
			motion of a body through it, yet it would be rigid and elastic, 
			although the fluid itself might be devoid of these properties�.<br>
				<b>6.</b> �...on the assumption that the independent carriers are of any 
			configuration such that the fluid resistance to motion in one 
			direction is greater than in another, a stress of that nature would 
			cause the carriers to arrange themselves in groups, since they would 
			turn to each other their sides of the greatest electrical density, 
			in which position the fluid resistance to approach would be smaller 
			than to receding.�<br><b>7.</b> �If in a medium of the above characteristics a brush would be 
			formed by a steady potential, an exchange of the carriers would go 
			on continuously, and there would be less carriers per unit volume in 
			the brush than in the space at some distance from the electrode, 
			this corresponding to rarefaction�.<br><b>8.</b> �If the potentials were rapidly changing, the result would be 
			very different; the higher the frequency of the pulses, the slower 
			would be the exchange of carriers; finally, the motion of 
			translation through measurable space would cease and, with a 
			sufficiently high frequency and intensity of the stress, the 
			carriers would be drawn towards the electrode, and compression would 
			result.�</font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The eight above excerpts are further reducible to the following four

			<blockquote>

				<font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1.</b> Mechanical motions can be produced by varying electrostatic force 
			acting through a gaseous (ether) medium, which thereby becomes 
			rigidified, yet allows solid bodies to pass through.<br><b>2.</b> Under influence of stress in one direction (under the polarizing 
			influence of light or heat), the carriers may group together, 
			forming tubes of force, creating greater ease of movement in that 
			direction.<br><b>3.</b> When a (D.C.) brush is created by a steady potential, a 
			continuous exchange of carriers is created corresponding to ether 
			rarefaction, as the tubes of force are drawn into the conductor.<br>
				<b>4.</b> With a sufficiently high frequency and stress intensity in the

			What were the old ether physicists referring to when they attempted 
			to describe �an incompressible, perfect fluid�? What would a 
			�perfect fluid� do? It would be able to �wet� everything it came 
			into contact with, such as protons, and could flow everywhere 
			without resistance. One �fluid��<b>the ether</b>�could flow everywhere, and 
			because of its density and ultra-fineness, nothing could stop it, 
			and it felt so resistance, but only matter felt resistance, 
			depending on the circumstances. Another fluid�electricity�could flow 
			in certain places, and wet only certain things, but often met 
			resistance.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			In order to understand the ether, we must get to know electricity 
			more intimately. Just like water, a <u>proton</u> will hold only so much 
			electricity on its surface, but the �surface� of the proton is 
			probably similar to the outer area of a ball-shaped swarm of 
			hovering mechanical bees, powered by the ZPR, with a denser 
			agglomeration of �bees� toward the �ball�s� center. If this swarm of 
			bees is subjected to a wave of rainy mist (the etheric �wind�), the 
			bees must all turn to face into the etheric wind to maintain their 
			formation. </font></p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The �water� droplets�electric sub-charges carried by the 
			etheric wind�tend to agglomerate around the front side. Each bee, as 
			he flaps his wings, will get wet only so much, so that excess 
			�water� is thrown off and carried to the next bee, or the next swarm 
			of bees, by the etheric wind, and so forth, so that a �current� of 
			droplets continues to flow through the ball of bees due to its 
			motion through the etheric wind, and transfers momentum between 
			masses. The �water� tends to come off in larger drops, which have 
			formed from smaller droplets accumulated on each bee. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">As in fluid 
			mechanics, the �drop� size is the result of cohesiveness of the 
			electric �fluid�, the surface area of each �bee�, and the space 
			between each bee, all of which influences the final size of each 
			larger �drop� (the �electron�) which accumulates enough to form it. 
			If one were to mathematically analyze the flow of �drops� (i.e., 
			�quanta�) per mass unit, they would have an average rate of the flow 
			of charges/cm3 of etheric wind, for the momentum, as determined by 
			the �current� flow rate.</font></p>

			Much like the bees, as a body (its many electrons, atoms, and 
			molecules, with plenty of �space� within and between) sits at rest 
			on the earth, it moves at fantastic speed through the universal 
			ether field, due to the earth�s revolution, orbit, and other 
			motions.</font></p>

				<font face="Arial" size="2">�...for in a medium of the properties of the ether, we cannot

				<font face="Arial" size="2">�The puzzling behavior of the ether as a solid to waves of light and

				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">

			<blockquote>
				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
				<font face="Arial" size="2">�...Electricity, therefore, cannot be called ether in the
