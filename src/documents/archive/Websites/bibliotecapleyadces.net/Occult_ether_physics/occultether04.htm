			The ether is a universal medium, which fills all space. It appears 
			to be “dynamic” relative to an earth moving thousands of miles per 
			hour through space. The ether is normally electrically neutral, 
			ultra-fine, and penetrates all solid matter. There is also an ultra 
			high frequency, ubiquitous radiation, normally in equilibrium, 
			called 
			<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_zeropointenergy.htm">
			<font color="#0000DD">Zero Point Radiation</font></a> (“<b>ZPR</b>”), which interpenetrates the 
			ether, and represents electromagnetic radiation in its finest, 
			densest form, which, in conjunction with the ether, conserves 
			universal perpetual motion. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><u>The ether in conjunction with the ZPR</u>, 
			is <b>the source of all matter and force</b>. “Energy” does not exist in 
			physical form, but is “the ability to do work”, which is equal to 
			“force over time”. The word “energy” is a convenient fiction, like 
			“time”, which is an arbitrary measurement of the rate of motion of 
			matter through ether-filled space. All events occur in the present, 
			and the “past” and “future” are merely metaphors. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Electromagnetic disturbances in the 
			ether extract “energy” from the ZPR, which is explainable only by an 
			ether theory. This “free energy”, which is virtually unlimited, is 
			universally at work, created by the perpetual motion of matter, and 
			the perpetual exchange of stronger and weaker forces, through which 
			the equilibrium of the universe is maintained, the sum total of all 
			processes equaling zero.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Since all solid matter is continually hurling through space, always 
			in motion, it is always subjected to the “etheric wind” and ZPR 
			interactions. These effects are not perceived except during changes 
			in the orientation of mass or its velocity. All mass and space have 
			dielectric properties. Differences in dielectric properties cause 
			changes in the electromagnetic displacement within mass and the 
			etheric wind. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Earth’s electric field creates 
			dielectric displacement effects within ether and mass within earth’s 
			electric field. The difference between the dielectric displacement 
			within a mass and the dielectric displacement outside the mass in 
			the etheric wind, creates a down-force in the direction of the 
			negative polarity, as the etheric wind ‘blows’ through a mass. This 
			is called “gravity”.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Since all mass is in motion, all mass has momentum, even when 
			apparently “at rest” relative to earth. Momentum is a body’s 
			resistance to change in its state of motion. Since inertia is also 
			the resistance of a body to changes in its momentum, inertia and 
			momentum are due to the same thing, the resistance of 
			electromagnetic micro helical tubules to changes in velocity (and 
			relative “pitch”), direction, and lateral motions or orientation. 
			Since all space and mass is composed only of “electric content”, 
			momentum/inertia is electromagnetic in nature, and can be 
			electromagnetically synthesized.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			All mass contains electrostatic charges, which when “carried around” 
			in the ether/ZPR-filled space by celestial or ‘local’ movement, 
			constitute currents. These currents actually flow between mass and 
			the ether, and are integral to the mechanism by which momentum is 
			imparted to mass in motion. The currents create magnetic fields as 
			their equal-and-opposite counterparts, and give a rotatory motion to 
			combined, bi-directional electric and magnetic fields and currents, 
			around irrotational vacuous ether cores. </font></p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">This rotatory electromagnetic action 
			creates momentum, as the force-free “screw-type” reaction within 
			mass, creating its motion relative to the ether cores, from which 
			the mechanical force is transferred to the atomic mass with which 
			the electromagnetism is associated.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Since these phenomena are electromagnetic in nature, they are 
			synthesized by recreation of the electromagnetic conditions which a 
			body would exhibit due to a particular kinetic state. Just as 
			electromagnetic waves of low frequency can penetrate a body, waves 
			of higher frequencies—above LR. and below U.V.—can cause the ether 
			to “assert its inertia resistance”.<br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The technology involves high voltage 
			D.C. ‘brush’ currents, high frequency currents, rapidly varying 
			electrostatic forces, and light/heat beams. The rapidly varying 
			electrostatic forces “rarify” (stretch) the ether carriers, as the 
			light/heat beams polarize the medium in the desired direction, as 
			the D.C. brush currents induce the exchange of carriers, creating a 
			vacuum in that direction, inducing motion. </font></p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">At the opposite end of the ship, high 
			frequency currents draw the carriers through the ship, and creates a 
			compression of the ether, as it penetrates the solid mass and 
			synthesizes the rotatory micro helical tubules, which whirl around 
			the ether cores along the polar axis, at a pitch corresponding to a 
			particular rate of momentum. Since the strength of the 
			electromagnetic interaction is 1040 time greater than the 
			gravitational interaction, that much more work can theoretically be 
			done in the same time, using the same “energy”.</font></p>

			Since “seeing is believing”, and I have seen, I believe. The

			right in his opposition to Relativism, and that the prevalent 
			theories taught in the scientific institutions of the world are 
			patently fraudulent. Consistent with the idea that “dynamite comes

			concealed, while at the same time, from the standpoint of the

			technology which would destroy their iron grip on us, could be

			energy coming out of a reaction, must go into the reaction, only 
			from a “non-ether” source recognized by them, and only in the 
			discrete “quanta” permitted by their misapplication of Max Planck’s

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The basic idea of Planck’s original 
			quantum mechanical theory, was that energy levels of atoms must 
			change in whole number integers (1,2,3, etc.), called “quanta”, 
			which are based on the basic charge of a single electron, which 
			assumes only certain assigned energy levels in different atoms and 
			molecules, and is used to define the magnitude of all of the

			<font face="Arial" size="2">All atomic energy changes must  
			conform to the permissible whole number equivalents or multiples of 
			these quanta. Accordingly, energy absorbed by an atom must fit this 
			stringent criterion. Despite what I consider to be obvious attempts 
			to conceal basic physical data conflicting with this principle—as 
			misinterpreted by the Relativists and incorporated into their 
			theory, as if it were exclusively their theory and not that 
			published earlier by Planck—the process I am about to discuss with 
			you has glaring inconsistencies in it, even as described and mis-measured

			<font face="Arial" size="2">It is said by them that the process of 
			dissociating diatomic hydrogen molecules into separate atoms as 
			atomic hydrogen, requires the absorption of 109,000 cal./gram 
			molecule (“1.9 k.cal./gram molecule”). Yet, in taking the basic 
			hydrogen atom and considering all its discrete ‘quanta’—whether in 
			the atomic or molecular state—it appears to me that there is no 
			state of the hydrogen atom or molecule in which such energy could be 
			“stored”, even when using the RQMs’ theories, especially in view of 
			their irrational statement that the energy is still possessed by the 
			molecule after it has already been released! It is their contention 
			that an independent hydrogen atom can only exist as such because it 
			has absorbed an abnormally large amount of heat, despite the fact 
			that by their own criteria the atom has no mechanism, identifiable 
			by them by which it could do so. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The RQMs never directly measured the 
			amount of dissociation energy necessary to bring the hydrogen atom 
			from the diatomic to the atomic state, because they didn’t know how 
			to do so, but because their theory said that “all reactions are 
			reversible”, they said the dissociation energy was the same as the 
			energy released on recombination of hydrogen atoms. Then to make 
			matters worse, they defined the atomic hydrogen (ground) state as if 
			it were an excited state, and the molecular state as if it were the

			Realistically, the atomic hydrogen reaction can only be 
			satisfactorily explained by reference to, construction of, or 
			re-construction of, an ether theory. While it may be arguable that 
			the “binding energy” between the two atoms of the molecule somehow 
			‘includes’ this energy in some undefined and mysterious way, this 
			argument actually supports an ether theory, because the binding 
			energy must somehow be exchanged with the energy which is released 
			when the molecule forms, consistent with the equal and opposite 
			reaction rule. Otherwise, one is expected to believe a kind of 
			backwards Orwellian doublethink kind of thing that the RQMs have 
			perpetrated, since “...everything is like relative, man.” This kind 
			of latitude is permitted only for them, while those who disagree are

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			The doublethink features of Relativism stem from the fact that 
			Albert Einstein was a Kaballist-Existentialist—and an 
			Illuminist—whose epistemology was a Platonist one. In philosophy, 
			there are two basic epistemologies—theories of the origin, nature 
			and limits of human knowledge—representing the two basic categories 
			into which the epistemologies of all philosophies must fall, and 
			which are supposed to explain how one knows something according to a 
			particular philosophy...by what means they know it...if in fact, 
			they do “know” it. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Since he who asserts something has the

			without reason, or a valid means of knowing it to be “true”. All

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			The “Platonist Epistemology” is so named because of the theory 
			illustrated by the cave analogy, in the ancient Greek Philosopher, 
			Plato’s book, The Republic. In Plato’s cave analogy, an observer 
			inside a cave, facing the inner wall at night, sees only the shadows 
			cast upon the wall by such things as a passing caravan, projected by 
			a fire burning beyond a road along which a caravan is passing.

			<font face="Arial" size="2">According to Plato, man cannot know 
			reality, but sees only a ‘shadow’ of reality, because there is a 
			‘higher world’ of ‘perfect forms’, which exist only ‘in heaven’. It 
			therefore becomes obvious how this epistemology follows religious 
			thinking, and that many religions have been influenced by it as 
			somehow adding ‘scientific credence’ to their religious ideas, which 
			are based on faith rather than reason. The same reasoning has been 
			used by scientific, philosophical, economic, political, and 
			‘spiritual’ con-artists for centuries, and every totalitarian 
			philosophy ever known has relied upon this fallacious ‘reasoning’ 
			which is identical to the Platonist epistemology. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">One wonders how the viewer in Plato’s 
			cave would draw the line between ‘knowing’ a shadow, and a “shadow 
			of a shadow”, since a shadow might also have a ‘higher form’, under 
			this theory. The “Aristotelian Epistemology” in the meanwhile—based 
			on the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle’s theory—holds that the 
			senses are valid, scientific tools of cognition, which we can rely 
			upon, to detect the facts of perceivable reality, and that we 
			can, by relying upon the facts so perceived, know reality and

			As can be seen from a comparison of these two epistemologies and

			Epistemology are more rational and objective, especially when 
			applied to the natural sciences. It can also be seen that the use of 
			a Platonist Epistemology by a physicist should be considered 
			unforgivable, while Einstein’s theory, built upon this fatally

			device (similar to that shown on page vii), with the provision that 
			I not use his name. I suggested using an iron pipe and 15 kv 
			transformer, based on Tesla’s use of an iron “antenna” in a Colorado 
			Springs experiment. With an approx. .1 amp/120 volt input (12 
			watts), an output of 48 kw was achieved. Since the K-capture level 
			of iron is 7,110 volts, I suggested tuning the two 7,500-volt legs 
			to 7,110 with a variac (total voltage 14,220), at which the output 
			jumped to 66 kw, a gain of over 38%. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">With 120 v/.l amps/60 cps/14.22 kv going

			can be extracted by high voltage high frequency filter and 
			rectifier, thence reduced to usable electric power with an inverter.</font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			In “K-capture”, the innermost “K-orbit” electron of iron drops into 
			the nucleus, converting a proton into an extra neutron. This appears 
			to render the iron unstable (i.e., “radioactive” in the Tesla 
			sense), so that it disturbs the equilibrium of and reacts with the 
			ZPR, converting some of it into an electrical output, via the iron. 
			This device has also been said to transmute zinc to mercury, when

				William Lyne was born in Big Spring, Texas in 1938 and raised in 
				west Texas oil boom towns, two years in the Bay Area of northern 
				California during WW II, and the southeast Texas Big Thicket 
				country. He has a B.S. in Fine Arts and Industrial Arts (1965) 
				from Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas, and an 
				M.F.A. in Studio Arts (1969) from the University of Texas at 
				Austin. He has been living in New Mexico for the past 27 years, 
				and resides just to the south of Santa Fe, in the little 
				railroad town of Lamy, with his 13-year-old son Angus.</font></p>

				In 1993, he published <i>Space Aliens From the Pentagon: Flying 
				Saucers are Man-Made Electrical Machines</i>. In 1995, a revised 
				and expanded second edition of this book was issued. The result 
				has been the illegal dissemination of a vast quantity of false 
				government propaganda, via covert intelligence agents in the 
				“UFOlogy” community, to overcome the effects of the book</font></p>
