			There is much consternation today about the words “cult” and 
			“occult”, and what they mean. Many are worried that their own

				<font face="Arial" size="2">As

			“off-limits” to the public or to private individuals, by a powerful

			the public has been “screened” to eliminate references to it? </font>

			convictions were later corroborated when I acquired a piece of 
			hardware from a 1943 German flying saucer at Sandia Base where <u>La 
			Paz</u> worked. Since the truth about electropropulsion is based on 
			“ether” (A.K.A. “aether”) physics, which has been collected, hidden 
			away, or declared “national security secrets”, or intentionally 
			obliterated by false propaganda which is so intense that the general

			Tesla’s original vision, in his 1870’s student days, of his “ideal 
			flying machine”, was of an <u>electropulsive</u> one, the realization of 
			which is why he said he originally entered the field of electrical 
			science in 1875 in the first place. This was the problem which he 
			had assigned to himself as his main lifelong work. (Frank Parker 
			Stockbridge, The Tesla Turbine. The World’s Work, march, 1912, pp. 
			543-48.)</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Originally anticipating that the electrical power needs for an 
			<i>electropropulsive craft</i> would be too great for an on-board power 
			plant (since his ship was to be devoid of sustaining planes), he 
			initially embarked on developing his “wireless transmission of 
			power” system, so as to transmit the anticipated power needed from 
			ground-based power generators and stations. Some of these earlier 
			<b>Tesla</b> ideas turned out to be unnecessary for his flying machine, so 
			he turned them for intended commercial purposes. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">Since his 
			conception of the ether was of a relatively low-density one, and his 
			conception of the electromagnetic force not nearly so much stronger 
			than the gravitational one, his later discovery that his prior 
			anticipation of greater electrical power needs than actually 
			required, led to changes in his electropropulsive craft, and 
			produced plenty of surplus “spin-off’ technology.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			During the 1920’s, at a time when he was in great need of money to 
			complete his <i>electropropulsive ship</i>, he unsuccessfully attempted to 
			interest the U.S. government in some of this surplus “spin off’ 
			technology. In an unpublished article prepared but never published, 
			<b>Tesla</b> said: </font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
				<font face="Arial" size="2">“...we should push the development of flying machines

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The immediate 
			association here is between “flying machines” (not “<i>aeroplanes</i>”) and 
			“wireless transmission of energy”. <b>Tesla</b> had piles of patents which 
			produced him no money, because the <u>Morgans</u> and <u>Rockefellers</u> had 
			declared them off limits. No one could borrow money from the banks 
			to put one of these systems into practice, and anyone who was 
			foolish enough to do so on their own money could expect the wrath of 
			the gods to come down on them like lightening bolts from Zeus. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Due 
			to his imminent discovery that his on-board power needs would not be 
			so great, and a failure to interest anyone in the development of his 
			wireless energy transmission system, <b>Tesla</b> obtained a patent in 1913 
			on a remarkable turbine he had invented about 1909. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">This was 
			probably in view of encouraging developments and awareness which 
			showed that the electromagnetic interaction is 1040 times stronger 
			than the gravitational interaction (<u>George Gamow</u>, <i>Gravity</i>, Anchor 
			Books, N.Y. [1962], p. 138). According to <b>Hendrick Lorenz</b>, the 
			electrical attractive force is 2 x 10<sup>39</sup> times stronger than the 
			gravitational attractive force.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			The change in Tesla’s strategy seems to have occurred between his 
			1915 test of an electropropulsive missile using wireless energy 
			projected to it by a power beam from the ground, and his 1934 
			birthday announcement. These new developments were probably spurred 
			on by the mother of invention, since without a wireless energy 
			system, the prior conception would be rather useless. The power 
			monopolists could fight that off forever, so Tesla was left to his 
			own devices, unable to count on anyone else.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			The earlier misconceptions were still somewhat in Tesla’s mind when 
			he developed the turbine commercially under the <i>Tesla Propulsion 
			Company slogan</i>, “20 Horsepower Per Pound”, with the undisclosed 
			intention of also using the turbine to drive one of his specially 
			designed high frequency alternators to power the ship. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">After having 
			developed such a light and powerful turbine, which could turn 
			upwards of 30,000 rpm., with a twenty pound unit producing over 200 
			brake horsepower on gasoline, he also designed and received a patent 
			in 1928 for a new kind of “VTOL”-type propellor-driven airplane, to 
			be powered by two turbines mounted in tandem, which would counteract 
			the torque of the prop, and eliminate the need for the stabilizing 
			props that helicoptors have on their back fuselages. This aircraft, 
			if built, would have had a superior weight to-horsepower 
			ratio—perhaps three-to-one—and would have been very fast in level 
			flight, taking off vertically.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Tesla, on seeing the inefficient use of heavier aircraft engines 
			then in use, and the requirements of more cumbersome aircraft with 
			greater wing area, apparently wished to commercialize on the turbine 
			by designing and patenting the new airplane, which specifically used 
			his turbine, to raise needed capital to complete his more expensive 
			<u>electropropulsive project</u>. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">In his experiences with prior patents, he 
			had learned that a patent would be worthless unless he could get the 
			needed capital to carry the project out before the patent period 
			expired, and that the disclosure in a patent would allow others to 
			do so only 17 years after a patent might be granted to him, during 
			which time his invention could languish for lack of funding on his 
			part, because the monolithic financial interests were set against 
			him.</font></p>

			While in the initial stages of development, <b>Tesla</b> seemed quite 
			unaware of the true power of “the force”, until his early field 
			tests of 1915 proved that it was “tremendous”. In the years 1893 and 
			1894, Tesla had “completely worked out” his <i>Dynamic Theory of 
			Gravity</i>, that is, at least in “theory”. Inherent to that theory, was 
			his <u>electropropulsion system</u>, yet in the formative and theoretical

			<font face="Arial" size="2">To publish his theory however, would have been tantamount to

			invention of mankind. Tesla lacked the necessary money, and could 
			not raise it. He could not protect himself by patent, until he

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Fatefully, it was

			My basic ether particle is called the “<u>Omni</u>”, which has a positive 
			nucleus—a “protette” called an “Omnion”—and a negative sub-10 
			electron—an “electrette” called an “Omnitron”. As you may have 
			noticed, this scheme is a scaled-down version of the basic hydrogen 
			atom, with its proton and electron. Like most atoms, <u>the Omni</u> is 
			normally neutral and in equilibrium, but is much smaller, being 
			ultra-fine. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">Due to its tiny size and neutrality, it can pass easily 
			through “solid bodies” (except the solid bodies are actually passing 
			by and through it), yet it behaves like a solid in respect to high 
			frequency electromagnetic radiation of specific range, from the 
			infra-red through the visible light frequencies, which disturb its 
			equilibrium, yet, though we can feel it, it appears to be 
			transparent and invisible to the naked eye.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Like hydrogen gas, there is some elasticity, due to the 
			compressibility of the magnetic fields, so it is an “elastic solid” 
			as Faraday said. Due to the tiny Omni size, so-called “empty space” 
			is actually packed almost solid with this very fine matter, which 
			oscillates at such high frequencies—well beyond that of x-rays—yet 
			the tiny size and normal neutrality allows it to penetrate “solid 
			mass”—which is mostly “space” (which is also saturated with Omni 
			which must be moved through by a mass to make room for more Omni).</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Since interstellar ‘space’ is equivalent to a vacuum containing 
			little gaseous matter—such as a <i>Lenard tube</i> in which charges easily 
			move—the Omni in interstellar space is highly conductive, with 
			charges moving freely from body to body, along magnetic lines of 
			force. Omni-packed space is also omnidirectionally interpenetrated 
			by ultra-fine radiation, which is normally in equilibrium, called 
			“<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_zeropointenergy.htm"><font color="#0000DD">Zero Point Radiation</font></a>” (“<b>ZPR</b>”). </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">This ZPR constantly “twangs” the 
			electron clouds of atomic matter, creating the illusion of “electron 
			orbits”, which are in fact standing waves in the undulating layers 
			of electronic clouds surrounding atoms and molecules. Since the 
			matter with which these electron clouds are associated is in 
			constant motion, the clouds are currents, since a “charge carried 
			around is a current”. The driving force behind the currents is the 
			motion, which, so long as uniform, is “forcefree”. Any lost momentum 
			is ‘made up’ by the ZPR.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			The <u>Omni</u> has an almost balanced charge-to-mass ratio (“1:1”), and 
			responds to both positive and negative impulses. Electrostatic 
			generators provide a good example of the electrical behavior of the 
			Omni. At sufficiently high voltages, the positive and negative 
			dynamic sub-charges are separated by magnetic fields and condensed 
			to form electrons and protons. </font></p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">There is some unknown underlying 
			reason why these charges are of specific magnitude, which is yet to 
			be explained, but the quantum theory practically admits that 
			there are subdivisions of basic electrical charges, and that 
			electrons are not “indivisible”. This the basic bone of contention, 
			since if electrons are divisible, Relativism must fall. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The “basic 
			charge” which has been perceived as that of the electron, appears to 
			be time-related, since electrical current moves at the same speed as 
			light, therefore, the electron charge is probably the quantity of 
			charge accumulated from a discrete number of Omni over some discrete 
			unit of time, which reflects in turn the distance traveled through 
			space of a proton during that time, with the charges actually 
			circulating between the Omni and matter.</font></p>

			High voltage force—either in electrical discharges or in 
			radiation—is necessary to break the Omnion-Omnitron bond. The same 
			principle applies to electropulsion. Strong, high voltage, high 
			frequency negative pulses are necessary to penetrate the negative 
			Omnitronic cloud barriers, to react with the positive Omnions, to 
			cause the “inertia resistance” of the Omni to be “asserted”, so as 
			to access its mass to be pulled against, to propel a space ship 
			through Omni-packed space, using a microhelical “screwing” force of 
			rotating electromagnetic tubules around irrotational, vacuous Omni 
			cores. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			The great number of Omni per volume of space represents a much 
			greater density of positive matter than normal ‘solid’ mass 
			possesses, hence the Omni function as “virtually stationary anchors” 
			which an <i>electropulsive craft</i> can lock onto to propel itself through 
			space. The Omni ‘anchors’ are in fact dynamic relative to earth, 
			with a relative velocity of thousands of miles per hour which 
			represents the ultimate velocity of the earth through the ether at 
			any given time. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Since the “accessing” <u>electropulsive force</u>, when in

			comparative difference in velocity between the Omni and the earth is 
			almost insignificant It is practically “as if the earth is 
			stationary relative to the ether, except for the effects of 
			so-called gravity. To an effect which travels at 186,000 miles per

			The difference in density between liquid hydrogen and the Omni,
			for example, is relative to the difference in size between the 
			hydrogen
			atom and the tiny Omni, as well as to the volume of space actually
			occupied by the <b>Omnion</b> in relation to its Omnitron. It can be 
			assumed
			that a tiny Omnion, being a subdivision of the proton, has a much
			greater density per unit of space, due to the relative lack of space

			Low frequency electromagnetic waves can pass through solid bodies,

			<font color="#0000DD">Colorado Springs

			Many of Tesla’s tests in Colorado were related to <u>electropulsion</u>. A 
			long wave affects the internal mass of a space ship, “synthesizing 
			momentum”, by invoking the rotatory motion of electromagnetism, to 
			create the drill-like electromagnetic microhelices (“tubes of 
			force”) which “bore through” the ether as the mass moves. At the 
			same time, a higher frequency at the opposite end of the ship, 
			opposite to the direction of travel, causes the ether to be 
			accelerated as it passes through the mass of the ship and its 
			contents, with an increased angle of pitch, so the microhelical 
			boring action propels the ship through space. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Low frequency waves</u> 
			also make it possible to project forceful longitudinal

			carried directionally to a distant point by the carrier beam, can in 
			turn carry additional higher frequency waves superimposed on it, to 
			deliver the high frequency exciting energy, at the powerful 
			long-wave peaks. This was the basis for Tesla’s “<i>Transmission of

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The manipulation of these wave characteristics is 
			inextricably involved in <b>electropulsion</b>, stimulated by Tesla’s study 
			of the works of 19th century “ether physicists”, and his own 
			brilliant creative intuitions of the 24 rotating magnetic field, in 
			Budapest Hungary, in 1882. This rotating magnetic field discovery 
			was involved in his electropulsion discovery, because Tesla realized 
			that the rotatory force of magnetic fields could be used to 
			synthesize the rotating “tubes of force”, the naturally occurring 
			phenomena in solid bodies spoken of by <u>Faraday</u> and <u>Maxwell</u> and known 
			to Tesla, to propel a ship through space. The tubes had also been 
			discussed in 1881, by <b>J.J. Thomson</b> in England, but Thomson had never 
			related the tubes specifically to the ether until after <b>Nikola Tesla</b> 
			had connected the tubes to his intended electropulsion.</font></p>

			Tesla discovered that by using a low frequency beam-directed pulse,
			he could cause, at the quarter wavelength, the eruption of a large 
			electromagnetic pulse which could, by carrying a much higher 
			exciting wave, excite the atmospheric gases in a region, to explosively 
			expand them, followed by a tremendous implosion and the absorption of a 
			great
			amount of heat in the area, causing immediate freezing. This process
			would create an initial explosive shock wave followed by the 
			implosive

			<font face="Arial" size="2">For example, by using a

			frequency of 60 cps, with a wavelength of 3,100 miles, directed by
			carrier-beam, a pulse could be made to erupt at one-quarter 
			wavelength- 775 miles, corrected to 751 miles by velocity factor. By 
			superimposing an exciting frequency of say 50 megahertz or so, the 
			atmospheric gases could be excited to cause a “cold implosion” which 
			absorbs heat. By altering the wavelength and the direction of 
			propagation, the results could be delivered to any terrestrial

			The <u>Tesla ion bulb</u>, fundamental to Tesla’s “beams”, is a solid 
			aluminum hemisphere, enclosed in a glass vacuum envelope, excited by 
			high voltage D.C. applied to the center of the hemispherical end. A 
			polarized beam is emitted normal to the flat face center. The 
			frequency is determined by the voltage. The ion beam polarizes, 
			concentrates, and guides a spherical, long wave front, amplified by 
			Tesla’s “extra coil”, to a distant target, which amplifies a higher 
			frequency wave front superimposed upon it, which will “ring” in-the 
			target area at one-quarter wavelength, in fact ring many times.</font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
			Outside the bulb, in close proximity to the beam, the high voltage 
			alternating current (“power wave”) of low frequency, is emitted by a 
			ring-shaped electrode, and is directed along the beam’s 
			atmospherically created conductive path, and is projected toward the 
			distant target where the one-quarter wave peak delivers it at its 
			“point” of greatest potential. This idea of Tesla’s may have been
