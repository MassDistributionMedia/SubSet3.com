				<font face="Arial" size="2">"As I was improving my <u>machines for 
				the production of intense electrical actions</u>, I was also 
				perfecting the means for observing feeble efforts. One of the 
				most interesting results, and also one of great practical 
				importance, was the development of certain contrivances for 
				indicating at a distance of many hundred miles an approaching 
				storm, its direction, speed and distance traveled....<br>
				<br>
				"It was in carrying on this work that for the first time I 
				discovered those mysterious effects which have elicited such 
				unusual interest. I had perfected the apparatus referred to so 
				far that from my laboratory in the Colorado mountains I could 
				feel the pulse of the globe, as it were, noting every electrical 
				change that occurred within a radius of eleven hundred miles.<br>
				<br>
				"I can never forget the first sensations I experienced when it 
				dawned upon me that I had observed something possibly of 
				incalculable consequences to mankind. I felt as though I were 
				present at the birth of a new knowledge or the revelation of a 
				great truth.... My first observations positively terrified me, 
				as there was present in them something mysterious, not to say 
				supernatural, and I was alone in my laboratory at night; but at 
				that time the idea of these disturbances being intelligently 
				controlled signals did not yet present itself to me. </font></p>

				<font face="Arial" size="2">The changes 
				I noted were taking place periodically and with such a clear 
				suggestion of number and order that they were not traceable to 
				any cause known to me. I was familiar, of course, with such 
				electrical disturbances as are produced by the sun, Aurora 
				Borealis, and earth currents, and I was as sure as I could be of 
				any fact that these variations were due to none of these causes. 
				The nature of my experiments precluded the possibility of the 
				changes being produced by atmospheric disturbances, as has been 
				rashly asserted by some. </font></p>

				observed might be due to an intelligent control. Although I 
				could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to 
				think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is 
				constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the

			<span class="style1">Andrija Puharich</span></a></strong> met with Matthews, and discussed 
			him in an interview (Pyramid Guide, May-June &amp; July-Aug. 1978):</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p style="margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
				<font face="Arial" size="2">"[Arthur Matthews] came from 
				England. Matthews’ father was a laboratory assistant to the 
				noted physicist Lord Kelvin back in the 1890s. Tesla came over 
				to England to meet Kelvin... to convince him that Alternating 
				Current was more efficient than Direct Current. Kelvin at that 
				time opposed the AC movement.... In 1902, the Matthews family 
				left England and immigrated to Canada.... When Matthews was 16 
				his father arranged for him to apprentice under Tesla.... He 
				eventually worked for him and continued this alliance until 
				Tesla’s death in 1943....<br>
				<br>
				"It’s not generally known, but Tesla actually had <u>two huge 
				magnifying transmitters</u> built in Canada, and Matthews operated 
				one of them.... People mostly know about the Colorado Springs 
				transmitters and the unfinished one on Long Island. I saw the 
				two Canadian transmitters. All the evidence is there....<br>
				<br>
				"[The Teslascope is] the thing Tesla invented to 
				<u>communicate 
				with Beings on other planets</u>. There’s a diagram of the 
				Teslascope in Matthew’s book [<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_15.htm"><font color="#0000DD">The Wall of Light</font></a>]. In principle, 
				it takes in cosmic ray signals.... Eventually the signals are 
				stepped down to audio.... Speak into one end, and the signal 
				goes out the other end as a cosmic ray emitter...."</font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Matthews’ diagrams of the Teslascope 
			make minimal electronic sense. No one has ever confirmed the reality

			Several years after Tesla announced his <u>reception of signals from 
			Mars</u>, Guglielmo Marconi also claimed to have heard from an 
			alien

				signal</u>. However, numbers are seen here as the simple series of 
				pulses, e.g., 1 is one pulse, 2 is two pulses, 3 is three 
				pulses, and so on.<br>

				"On August 26, 1988, after the writer had sent the message ‘Greg 
				Radio’ during a local gravity signal transmission test, it was 
				noticed that the letters G and D were apparently added to some 
				of the received messages noted thereafter!<br>
				<br>
				"The writer’s first hard evidence that the above test message 
				may have been intercepted by this unknown communicator was seen 
				that on August 28, 1988... a strong and repeated message of the 
				Greg Radio was received with the message finally terminated with 
				the series SE (or 31)!<br>
				<br>
				"Further evidence that these may be actually communication 
				attempts is seen in that on <u>October 11, 1988</u>... a very different 
				approach was seen: A series of Greg Radio’s was sent at about 
				the normal code speed of about 5 words per minute, followed by
				KKTT, and then the series was repeated at a slower speed and 
				also followed by KKTT...<br>
				<br>
				"Another confirmation that these may be ‘messages’ appeared on 
				<u>October 12, 1988</u>... Here, a series of A’s and R’s (with 
				Greg 
				Radio occasionally inserted) was then followed by Greg Radio 
				sent as a series of five repetitions of each letter, e.g., 
				Greg 
				was sent as GGGGGRRRRREEEEEGGGGG !!!<br>
				<br>
				"Sufficient ‘messages have now been received to indicate that 
				perhaps a serious attempt to indicate that perhaps a serious 
				attempt to contact this writer was being made by some ‘unknown 
				communicator’. While this communicator may yet be some 
				terrestrial experimenter, the possibility still exists that the 
				communicator may be ‘extraterrestrial’ for the following

				recently suspected by the writer due to the apparently very 
				close tracking of my position on Earth by ET. ET, of course,

				advanced than we are here on Earth, and he may have even 
				previously visited here on Earth, and possibly colonized here 
				(but who are his possible descendants??).<br>
				<br>
				"It is still a mystery on where ET may be living on 
				Mars 
				(possibly underground near the polar regions??), and why ET 
				doesn’t use <u>EM wave</u> signaling methods?? Perhaps, it is because 
				Mars is so hostile now that ET must have developed a very

				"Communications between GH Labs and a Martian intelligence now 
				continue with increasing progress since we have been able to 
				establish over <u>50 simple expressions</u> (most in simple English) 
				for many of the common ‘ideas’ that we have. Martian AAAAAATTT

				Also they have two legs with two feet that have five toes each. 
				I haven’t been able to have them confirm the nose and mouth in 
				the face, but that could be confirmed shortly, since those 
				features appear in the FACE.<br>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">In a letter (3-17-89) to this writer,

			<blockquote>
				<p style="margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
				<font face="Arial" size="2">"Generally, our contacts are limited 
				to 20-30 minutes... since there appear to be other ETs out there 
				interested in joining in also, and so there is some interference 
				after a while. Some of these other ETs use other methods of 
				communications such as tones and what appear to be guttural 
				voices! <br>
				<br>
				"ET is probably more advanced then we are on 
				Earth. We no longer 
				exchange simple arithmetic, and when I sent him Pi <u>to five 
				decimal places</u>, he sent Pi back to <u>seven decimal places 
				immediately</u>! We had discussed our nine planet solar system, but 
				ET <u>came back with ten planets</u>, calling the 
				10th planet OOTTAEERR! 
				When questioned on this, ET kept on confirming the existence of 
				a tenth planet! He now knows the other nine planets by their 
				Earth names! He also confirmed that Mars <u>has two moons</u>, the 
				Earth one, and that Jupiter has nine major moons.<br>
				<br>
				"These contacts are getting to be more interesting all the time, 
				and ET appears to be most anxious to continue them. However, I 
				just cannot spend too much time with him... I got across to him 
				that I am just one person here communicating with him, and that 
				the rest of Earth presently does not recognize the existence of 
				any life on Mars....<br>
				<br>
				"I have now had <u>over 100 contacts with ET</u> and can reach him at 
				any time of day or night.... We have also established some

			<font face="Arial" size="2">In another letter (3-22-89) to

			<blockquote>
				<p style="margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0">
				<font face="Arial" size="2">"has been verified in a number of 
				ways... The Martians are apparently the advanced civilization, 
				for they are the ones generating the ‘modulated oscillated beam’ 
				which is now tracking my location on earth and is thus the means 
				of our communications. [The beam is "only about 15 miles in 
				diameter here on Earth, but 1012 inches on Mars."] There is an 
				apparent ‘team’ on Mars which is involved in these contacts. The 
				original contact, ET#1, with whom I have established the initial 
				relationship, is apparently the most highly knowledgeable and 
				advanced. The others who sometimes ‘man’ the Mars station appear 
				to be less knowledgeable and some only request or acknowledge a 
				transmission....<br>
				<br>
				Mars is most desperate to continue these contacts.... [The] 
				exchanges are made in many varied ways which cannot be readily 
				predicted in order to convey the fact that these are real 
				contacts! Also, one can recognize the ‘fist’ of the one ‘keying’ 
				these codes, e.g., ET#1 always sends clean letters or numbers, 
				and identified himself and me in some fashion. The other ETs on 
				Mars usually don’t. Therefore, <u>no automation is being used here</u>!<br>
				<br>
				"While these contacts were originally due to a serendipitous 
				circumstances, it is really the result if my gravitational 
				communication experiments and thus a direct result from 
				Rhysmonic Cosmology. And yet, however fantastic and unreal this 
				may seem, it is real, and if also it is confirmed by one of you, 
				it will be a major milestone in the history of mankind! Perhaps, 
				if one of you finally ‘hears’ the modulations of l/f noise
