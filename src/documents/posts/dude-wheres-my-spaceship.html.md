In FightForSpace's trailer linked from YouTube above, many great points are made about the dire importance of keeping NASA healthy financially. The speech by Neil deGrasse Tyson in the second half was conveyed strong, passionately and efficiently and was easy to understand; His message being: Inspiration & Ambition via space exploration are as a fuel to humanity/nationality for the best tomorrow available. 

As Neil deGrasse Tyson told us the founding reason for NASA was military fear of falling behind Russia. What does that say about the motive the American government to invest in space? Private space is picking up strong momentum and I believe that one day we'll look back and realize we didn't need to ask for progress in space when we could be the ones out there, hands on, making it happen.

Just look at how much more is getting done in private space already in shorter timelines and smaller budgets. The progress is apparent and the best part about it is we can literally all be involved in it if we want to. If there isn't a seeming way into the private space industry, you can make one. Even better you can work on exactly the part(s) of space that you're most passionate about. 

A good analogy is like asking someone to use their car. Number one, they(NASA) didn't buy their car for you to ever ride in it and number two "Why not get your own driver's license and your own car that you can drive anywhere anytime to do whatever you want with?" It’s like asking: "Dude, where's my spaceship?"

Why not be independent and take part in, right now, what is going to be the biggest foreseen future industry? Why would you keep begging your friend for a ride in his car when you can take action and get your own ride? It's not about the perceptions/awareness of an entire nation. It's not about who's not doing what and pointing fingers everywhere. It's about YOU. YOU personally, make space happen, period.

So NASA was inspirational why? Because we thought, even if in the back of our heads, that since NASA is doing these manned missions that maybe one day if I work in the fields of science or become a air force pilot, that I may too go to space; But NASA wasn't intended or ever even considered leveraging all of it's newly inspired from the Apollo missions and put them to work, let alone put them in space. It is just not for that, where in the private sector it is possible, because everyone is working on it, making it happen, not waiting for someone else to do it for them. Private industry finds niches, and has to be self sustaining to stick around. Private industry has the great potential to put all those inspired to work and into space. For example Elon Musk, CEO & Founder of SpaceX  (a rocket company in the USA) is proposing a Mars colony in the next 50 years with 80 thousand people shipping out to Mars annually. MarsOne is currently in the process of recruiting astronauts for a permanent Mars mission. Virgin Galactic is geared to take thousands into space in the next ten years and these are just the companies that get the media attention. Lesser known company, <a href=http://www.spaceoperationsinc.com/ target=_blank>Space Operations Inc</a> is hosting a open call for 4 qualified astronauts to fly in their new spaceship. 

FightForSpace's campaign shouldn't be about begging NASA for a penny. It should be about supporting existing private space entrepreneurs and furthering awareness about the cool projects they're engaged in and their story which their story will show how anyone can decide to be involved if they make that decision. It should be a campaign to private sector investors to invest and themselves become aware of all these new and exciting investment opportunities. It needn't be begging the government to invest in NASA in a time when they not only not investing/expanding any public programs, but instead are actively scaling them all back. 

When Buzz Aldrin publically replied to a SpaceX press release in 2012(I think it was 2012), saying that he thought at the time that big things like building such huge rockets should be left for big agencies like NASA or Boeing, it really got to Elon Musk, CEO & founder of SpaceX. Buzz was a childhood hero for Elon and when interviewed on 60 Minutes, Elon even shed a tear when reminded of Buzz’s words. SpaceX has obviously proved themselves over and over again with successful missions when it counts because Elon Musk, a private-space entrepreneur believed strongly, was passionate, but most of all, was hands on deeply involved and dedicated to the company.

How could you ask us to forsake all the lesser known private space companies who sweat and bleed daily following behind Elon on a march to a strong new private space industry? The days of NASA as a mega-agency inspiring the masses are just not the same anymore. It’s the private industry’s turn, every able person’s turn who wants in, it’s our turn now.

NASA itself is relying more and more on private space companies like SpaceX to make their missions cheaper and more effective. NASA is doing private contracts like never before in history. We should acknowledge the trend. 

Everyone that wants to really can get hands on with space right now TODAY. YOU TODAY CAN DO SPACE NOW. In one word, CubeSat. A <a href=http://www.cubesat.org/ target=_blank>CubeSat</a> is a "nanosatellite" that's a 10cm cube that could fit in your hand. It's a open standard which many universities, companies and agencies are developing CubeSat's and contributing to the nanosatellite standard. Approximately 75 CuteSats have been launched to date. CubeSat’s can orbit the earth and do all sorts of experiments, but what’s really exciting are some of the new CubeSat’s launching soon. CubeSat’s like <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESTCube-1 target=_blank>ESTCube-1</a> and <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightSail-1 target=_blank>LightSail-1</a>. ESTCube-1 (short for Estonia Cube) uses what’s called a electric sail which is really just a set of electrically charged wires spinning out from the center and interacting with comic winds (charged particles flung out from the Sun) which creates a little push. A very little push, but since the CubeSat is out in space and weightless with zero drag, that push picks up momentum and you're off to the sail snail races! Check out this illustration of how a e-sail interacts with cosmic wind:

 LightSail-1 is a 3U CubeSat (three CubeSats connected in a row, aka a peapod), which will deploy a “solar sail” which is a very reflective, flexible material that, when the Sun’s light (which is a radiation) hits the solar sail, that “hit” creates a push similar to how the e-sail takes a hit of cosmic wind(although be clear that comic wind and solar radiation are two separate things). ESTCube-1 is being done by a University in Estonia in partnership with private companies. LightSail-1 is being done by The Planetary Society, the largest space interest organization, but not a government agency of any kind and also in partnership with a handful of private space companies. Check out this video of LightSail-1's solar-sail being test-deployed:

 CubeSat's are the coolest, DIY space projects around yet of course there is the issue of getting them launched into orbit and but when asked: 'What's the hardest thing about going to the moon?' 
Von Braun replied, "The will to do it." 

Passion Produces Possibility. Just Do It! DO SPACE.
