When we ask that NASA be funded in a time of budget cuts all around, it isn't really fair to the government for us to simply say that NASA is important because without it there are no inspired people. Unless we have a semi-holistic understanding of the debt, budget cuts and what would be cut instead of NASA, then can we argue NASA's funding. We've seen in the recent news how the cuts/layoffs of air-traffic controller was causing the entire airline industry to break down in the USA and the politicians got them back to work that same week before they were off for vacation, but they had to cut other things to allow the air traffic controllers to return to their posts. Of course we could argue that the entire Federal government system is rigged and complain about that, but let's not. Instead let's understand the cuts and offer a serious tradeoff, a written paper outlining these things and make it open-source to be forked and crowdsourced and discussed. 

In the timeless book by Dale Carnagie "How to Win Friends and Influence People"(1937)([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)) explains cheifly how to see from the other person's point of view. It explains the best way to structure your proposal so that it is mutually beneficial and therefore most likely to transact. Without understanding all the other parties affected by the cuts (or at least the party proposed to be cut instead of NASA), then how can we expect our campaign to save NASA to be successful just because it's "important" (In quotations because it's probably not as important to the people deciding the cuts and especially not to the party(s) on the receiving end whatever is trading NASA's place to be cut)?

Which leads us to now imagine what it might be like to be a politician. Imagine to have to try to understand everyone's pleas, usually always from an external/remote plateau? If you were a politician would you weigh your decision on which party shouts the loudest? Or which party is that is present at every available mediation/conversation? By which group was most organized and effect, a group that had power itself? By which group donates the most to the you, the politician. Donations surely must make it easier to help make the decision of who to support. I mean politicians are humans after all and humans that live on planet earth where perfection, if it exists here at all, is all but for a nanosecond. I'm not saying that politicians should always choose to support whoever donates the most but let's face it, that's how it works currently. Nature likes to find the easiest way to do things. Think of how water navigates down gravitationally. Politicians don't always have the luxury of being experts and omniscient on the areas and the party views that they are making decisions on and therefore choosing via donation is the easiest path. So I argue that it's the nature of that game. Not saying all politicians make every decision this way, of course not, but I'm just describing what we all already know and I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I think there is a path here. Remember we are seeing from the politicians point of view for this discussion. We are in their clothes, at their office, we are the politician. 

So why not then would we also lobby for space, efficiently. Meaning not with the stigma that the word traditionally carries, but to engage the conversation from all sides, drawing from our collective knowledge (some of us being experts on the subjects of the parties that would be taking NASA's place in the budget cuts). Why don't we be that super organized, effective party that joins the conversations seeing it from as many other viewpoints as able and proposing from that shared point of view. A hybrid proposal, spiked with some lobby-love for our fellow politicians who we're working with. We need to support the politicians involved. We need to be genuine as Dale's book describes. We need to care not only for NASA but everyone present and then will we been seen as a real solution and not just a nagging voice from just another ear of a politician that we don't even know, and they don't even know us. 

A lot of what I just described as a proposed solution to save NASA from budget cuts is already happening. This is for us that didn't know about space-lobbying prior and for us who've never put each other in the politician's shoes. For us who have yet to read Dale Carnegie "How to Win Friends and Influence People"(1937) but will read it because it's on Audible so you don't even have to read it, you can just listen to it hands free while you go about your life. Please read it. If everyone on every side of the discussion read the book, much more understanding, friendships between parties and progress would result.
